## üåü Overview

InstructionKit is a powerful CLI tool that enables developers to **browse, install, and manage** instructions for AI coding assistants. Download instruction repositories to your local library, browse them with an interactive TUI, and install exactly what you need. Whether you're standardizing your team's coding practices, sharing best practices across projects, or building a personal library of prompts, InstructionKit makes it effortless.

**Supports:** Cursor ‚Ä¢ GitHub Copilot ‚Ä¢ Windsurf ‚Ä¢ Claude Code

> **CLI name:** The command-line entry point is `inskit`. Older docs may reference `instructionkit`; use `inskit` for all commands.

**New:** Interactive TUI for browsing and selecting instructions from your library!

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
pip install instructionkit
```

### The New Way: Library + Interactive TUI

**Step 1: Download instructions to your library**

```bash
# Download from GitHub
inskit download --from https://github.com/company/instructions

# Download from local folder (for testing)
inskit download --from ./my-instructions
```

**Step 2: Browse and install with the TUI**

```bash
# Launch the interactive browser
inskit install
```

This opens a beautiful terminal UI where you can:

- üîç Search and filter instructions
- ‚òëÔ∏è Select multiple instructions with Space/Enter
- üéØ Pick which AI tools to install to
- üì¶ Install with confirmation to your project

**Step 3: Manage your library**

```bash
# See what's in your library
inskit list library

# Update to get latest changes
inskit update --all

# Remove a repository
inskit delete <repo-namespace>
```

### Alternative: Direct Installation

For quick one-off installs without using the library:

```bash
# Direct install (bypasses library)
inskit install python-best-practices --from https://github.com/company/instructions

# See what's available from a repo
inskit list available --from https://github.com/company/instructions
```

## üìñ Usage

### Library Management

<details>
<summary><b>Download Instructions to Your Library</b></summary>

Build your local library of instruction repositories:

```bash
# Download from Git repository
inskit download --from https://github.com/company/instructions

# Download from local folder
inskit download --from ./my-instructions

# Re-download to get latest updates
inskit download --from https://github.com/company/instructions --force
```

Your library is stored in `~/.instructionkit/library/` and organized by repository namespace.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>List Your Library Contents</b></summary>

```bash
# Show all repositories in library
inskit list library

# Show individual instructions
inskit list library --instructions

# Filter by repository alias
inskit list library --source company
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Update Library Repositories</b></summary>

```bash
# Update a specific repository
inskit update --namespace github.com_company_instructions

# Update all repositories in library
inskit update --all
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Delete from Library</b></summary>

```bash
# Delete a repository (keeps installed instructions)
inskit delete github.com_company_instructions

# Skip confirmation
inskit delete github.com_company_instructions --force
```

Note: Deleting from library doesn't uninstall instructions. Use `inskit uninstall` for that.

</details>

### Interactive TUI Browser

<details>
<summary><b>Using the TUI to Browse and Install</b></summary>

Launch the interactive browser:

```bash
inskit install
```

**TUI Features:**

- **Search**: Type `/` to search by name or description
- **Filter**: Select repository from dropdown
- **Select**: Use `Space` or `Enter` to toggle instruction selection
- **Select All**: Press `Ctrl+A` or click "Select All" button
- **Target Tools**: Check boxes for Cursor, Windsurf, Claude Code, etc.
- **Install**: Review summary and click "üì¶ Install Selected"

The TUI shows exactly where files will be installed in your project before you confirm.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Install Specific Instruction by Name</b></summary>

Install directly from library without TUI:

```bash
# Install by name (opens selection if multiple matches)
inskit install python-style

# The command will:
# 1. Search your library for "python-style"
# 2. If found in multiple repos, ask which one
# 3. Install the selected instruction
```

</details>

### Installing Instructions

<details>
<summary><b>Project-Level Installation</b></summary>

InstructionKit installs all instructions at the **project level**:

**How it works:**

- All instructions are installed to your current project
- Stored in tool-specific directories in your project root:
  - **Claude Code**: `.claude/rules/*.md`
  - **Cursor**: `.cursor/rules/*.mdc`
  - **Windsurf**: `.windsurf/rules/*.md`
  - **GitHub Copilot**: `.github/instructions/*.md`
- Tracked in `<project-root>/.instructionkit/installations.json`
- Automatically detects project root (looks for `.git`, `pyproject.toml`, `package.json`, etc.)
- Can be run from any directory within the project

```bash
# Install to current project
inskit install python-best-practices --from https://github.com/company/instructions

# All installations are project-level
inskit install python-style

# List shows project installations
inskit list installed
```

**Why project-level?**

- Instructions stay with your code (version controlled)
- Team members get the same instructions automatically
- Different projects can have different instructions
- Clean, organized structure per tool

</details>

### Advanced: Direct Installation (Bypasses Library)

<details>
<summary><b>Install Directly from Repository</b></summary>

For one-off installs without downloading to library first:

```bash
# Basic install (to current project)
inskit install python-best-practices --from https://github.com/company/instructions

# Install to specific tool
inskit install python-best-practices --from https://github.com/company/instructions --tool cursor

# Handle conflicts by renaming
inskit install python-best-practices --from https://github.com/company/instructions --conflict rename

# Overwrite existing
inskit install python-best-practices --from https://github.com/company/instructions --conflict overwrite
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Install from Local Folder</b></summary>

```bash
# Relative path
inskit install python-best-practices --from ./my-instructions

# Absolute path
inskit install python-best-practices --from /path/to/instructions

# Great for testing before committing to Git
inskit install my-new-instruction --from ~/Documents/instruction-drafts
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Install Bundles</b></summary>

```bash
# Install a bundle of related instructions
inskit install python-backend --bundle --from https://github.com/company/instructions

# This might install: python-style, testing-practices, api-design, etc.
```

</details>

### Listing & Viewing

<details>
<summary><b>List Installed Instructions</b></summary>

```bash
# Show all installed instructions in current project
inskit list installed

# Filter by AI tool
inskit list installed --tool cursor

# Filter by source alias/name
inskit list installed --source company
```

Shows where each instruction is installed and which tools have it.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>List Available Instructions (Without Library)</b></summary>

Directly query a repository without downloading it:

```bash
# From Git repository
inskit list available --from https://github.com/company/instructions

# From local folder
inskit list available --from ./my-instructions

# Filter by tag
inskit list available --from https://github.com/company/instructions --tag python

# Show only bundles
inskit list available --from https://github.com/company/instructions --bundles-only
```

**Tip:** For regular use, it's better to `download` the repo to your library and browse with the TUI!

</details>

### Uninstalling Instructions

```bash
# Uninstall from all tools in current project
inskit uninstall python-best-practices

# Uninstall from specific tool
inskit uninstall python-best-practices --tool cursor

# Skip confirmation
inskit uninstall python-best-practices --force
```

### Viewing Detected Tools

```bash
# See which AI coding tools are installed
inskit tools
```

## üìÇ Storage & Tracking

InstructionKit stores everything locally:

**Library Storage:**

- Downloaded repositories: `~/.instructionkit/library/`
- Organized by repository namespace (e.g., `github.com_company_instructions/`)
- Browse offline after downloading

**Installation Tracking:**

- Tracked in `<project-root>/.instructionkit/installations.json`
- Contains metadata for all installed instructions in the project
- Created automatically when you install instructions
- **Recommended:** Commit to Git so team members get the same setup
- Alternative: Add to `.gitignore` if instructions should be personal

The `list installed` command shows all instructions in the current project.

## üìÅ Creating Your Own Instructions

InstructionKit works with simple folder structures - no Git repository required!

### Minimal Structure

```
