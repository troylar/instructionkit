## üöÄ Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
pip install instructionkit
```

### The New Way: Library + Interactive TUI

**Step 1: Download instructions to your library**

```bash
# Download from GitHub
instructionkit download --repo https://github.com/company/instructions

# Download from local folder (for testing)
instructionkit download --repo ./my-instructions
```

**Step 2: Browse and install with the TUI**

```bash
# Launch the interactive browser
instructionkit install
```

This opens a beautiful terminal UI where you can:
- üîç Search and filter instructions
- ‚òëÔ∏è  Select multiple instructions with Space/Enter
- üìç Choose installation location (Global or Project)
- üéØ Pick which AI tools to install to
- üì¶ Install with confirmation

**Step 3: Manage your library**

```bash
# See what's in your library
instructionkit list library

# Update to get latest changes
instructionkit update --all

# Remove a repository
instructionkit delete <repo-namespace>
```

### Alternative: Direct Installation

For quick one-off installs without using the library:

```bash
# Direct install (bypasses library)
instructionkit install python-best-practices --repo https://github.com/company/instructions

# See what's available from a repo
instructionkit list available --repo https://github.com/company/instructions
```

## üìñ Usage

### Library Management

<details>
<summary><b>Download Instructions to Your Library</b></summary>

Build your local library of instruction repositories:

```bash
# Download from Git repository
instructionkit download --repo https://github.com/company/instructions

# Download from local folder
instructionkit download --repo ./my-instructions

# Re-download to get latest updates
instructionkit download --repo https://github.com/company/instructions --force
```

Your library is stored in `~/.instructionkit/library/` and organized by repository namespace.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>List Your Library Contents</b></summary>

```bash
# Show all repositories in library
instructionkit list library

# Show individual instructions
instructionkit list library --instructions

# Filter by repository
instructionkit list library --repo company
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Update Library Repositories</b></summary>

```bash
# Update a specific repository
instructionkit update --namespace github.com_company_instructions

# Update all repositories in library
instructionkit update --all
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Delete from Library</b></summary>

```bash
# Delete a repository (keeps installed instructions)
instructionkit delete github.com_company_instructions

# Skip confirmation
instructionkit delete github.com_company_instructions --force
```

Note: Deleting from library doesn't uninstall instructions. Use `instructionkit uninstall` for that.

</details>

### Interactive TUI Browser

<details>
<summary><b>Using the TUI to Browse and Install</b></summary>

Launch the interactive browser:

```bash
instructionkit install
```

**TUI Features:**
- **Search**: Type `/` to search by name or description
- **Filter**: Select repository from dropdown
- **Select**: Use `Space` or `Enter` to toggle instruction selection
- **Select All**: Press `Ctrl+A` or click "Select All" button
- **Installation Location**: Choose Global (user config) or Project (current folder)
- **Target Tools**: Check boxes for Cursor, Windsurf, Claude Code, etc.
- **Install**: Review summary and click "üì¶ Install Selected"

The TUI shows exactly where files will be installed before you confirm.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Install Specific Instruction by Name</b></summary>

Install directly from library without TUI:

```bash
# Install by name (opens selection if multiple matches)
instructionkit install python-style

# The command will:
# 1. Search your library for "python-style"
# 2. If found in multiple repos, ask which one
# 3. Install the selected instruction
```

</details>

### Installing Instructions

<details>
<summary><b>Global vs Project Scope</b></summary>

InstructionKit supports two installation scopes:

**Global Scope (default):**
- Instructions available across all projects
- Stored in your AI tool's global config directory
- Tracked in `~/.instructionkit/installations.json`

**Project Scope:**
- Instructions specific to the current project
- Stored in `.cursor/instructions/`, `.windsurf/instructions/`, etc. in project root
- Tracked in `.instructionkit/installations.json` in project root
- Automatically detects project root (looks for `.git`, `pyproject.toml`, `package.json`, etc.)
- Can be run from any directory within the project

```bash
# Install globally (default)
instructionkit install python-best-practices --repo https://github.com/company/instructions

# Install to current project
instructionkit install python-best-practices --repo https://github.com/company/instructions --scope project

# List shows both global and project installations
instructionkit list installed
```

</details>

### Advanced: Direct Installation (Bypasses Library)

<details>
<summary><b>Install Directly from Repository</b></summary>

For one-off installs without downloading to library first:

```bash
# Basic install (global)
instructionkit install python-best-practices --repo https://github.com/company/instructions

# Install to current project
instructionkit install python-best-practices --repo https://github.com/company/instructions --scope project

# Install to specific tool
instructionkit install python-best-practices --repo https://github.com/company/instructions --tool cursor

# Handle conflicts by renaming
instructionkit install python-best-practices --repo https://github.com/company/instructions --conflict rename

# Overwrite existing
instructionkit install python-best-practices --repo https://github.com/company/instructions --conflict overwrite
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Install from Local Folder</b></summary>

```bash
# Relative path
instructionkit install python-best-practices --repo ./my-instructions

# Absolute path
instructionkit install python-best-practices --repo /path/to/instructions

# Great for testing before committing to Git
instructionkit install my-new-instruction --repo ~/Documents/instruction-drafts
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Install Bundles</b></summary>

```bash
# Install a bundle of related instructions
instructionkit install python-backend --bundle --repo https://github.com/company/instructions

# This might install: python-style, testing-practices, api-design, etc.
```

</details>

### Listing & Viewing

<details>
<summary><b>List Installed Instructions</b></summary>

```bash
# Show all installed instructions (both global and project)
instructionkit list installed

# Filter by AI tool
instructionkit list installed --tool cursor

# Filter by source repository
instructionkit list installed --repo https://github.com/company/instructions
```

Shows where each instruction is installed and which tools have it.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>List Available Instructions (Without Library)</b></summary>

Directly query a repository without downloading it:

```bash
# From Git repository
instructionkit list available --repo https://github.com/company/instructions

# From local folder
instructionkit list available --repo ./my-instructions

# Filter by tag
instructionkit list available --repo https://github.com/company/instructions --tag python

# Show only bundles
instructionkit list available --repo https://github.com/company/instructions --bundles-only
```

**Tip:** For regular use, it's better to `download` the repo to your library and browse with the TUI!

</details>

### Uninstalling Instructions

```bash
# Uninstall from all tools and scopes
instructionkit uninstall python-best-practices

# Uninstall only from project scope
instructionkit uninstall python-best-practices --scope project

# Uninstall only from global scope
instructionkit uninstall python-best-practices --scope global

# Uninstall from specific tool
instructionkit uninstall python-best-practices --tool cursor

# Skip confirmation
instructionkit uninstall python-best-practices --force
```

### Viewing Detected Tools

```bash
# See which AI coding tools are installed
instructionkit tools
```

## üìÇ Storage & Tracking

InstructionKit stores everything locally:

**Library Storage:**
- Downloaded repositories: `~/.instructionkit/library/`
- Organized by repository namespace (e.g., `github.com_company_instructions/`)
- Browse offline after downloading

**Installation Tracking:**

**Global Installations:**
- Tracked in `~/.instructionkit/installations.json`
- Contains metadata for all globally installed instructions
- Persists across all projects

**Project Installations:**
- Tracked in `<project-root>/.instructionkit/installations.json`
- Contains metadata only for this project's instructions
- Created automatically when you install with `--scope project`
- Can be added to `.gitignore` or committed to share with team

The `list installed` command automatically shows instructions from both scopes when run from within a project.

## üìÅ Creating Your Own Instructions

InstructionKit works with simple folder structures - no Git repository required!
