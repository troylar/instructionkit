# InstructionKit Roadmap (Personal - DO NOT COMMIT)

**Current Status:** 3 GitHub stars, v0.2.0, early adoption phase
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-24
**Focus:** Prove concept ‚Üí Get first 100 users ‚Üí Build ecosystem
**Current AI Tools:** 4 supported (Claude, Cursor, Windsurf, Copilot) | 9+ on roadmap

---

## Current Stage: Prove the Concept & Get Initial Users

At 3 stars, we're in discovery phase. Priority should be:
1. Making it dead simple for early adopters to try
2. Creating viral/shareable moments
3. Building credibility & examples
4. Removing friction to first value

---

## Tier 0: Critical Path to First 100 Users üéØ
**Do these NOW - they directly impact adoption**

### 1. Example Instruction Repository ‚≠ê HIGHEST PRIORITY
**Effort:** 1-2 days
**Impact:** Critical - empty library = abandoned tool

**Tasks:**
- Create `instructionkit/examples` repo on GitHub
- Build 10-15 high-quality, battle-tested instructions:
  - Python style & best practices
  - JavaScript/TypeScript patterns
  - React component guidelines
  - API design principles
  - Testing best practices
  - Git commit conventions
  - Documentation standards
  - Security guidelines
- Make it the default when someone runs first-time setup
- Include README with "how to use" for each instruction

**Why:** People need to see value in 30 seconds. Show don't tell.

---

### 2. One-Command Onboarding
**Effort:** 2-3 days
**Impact:** High - reduces time-to-value from 5 min ‚Üí 30 sec

**Implementation:**
```bash
inskit quickstart
# Does:
# 1. Downloads example repository automatically
# 2. Opens TUI to browse examples
# 3. Walks through first installation
# 4. Shows where files were installed
# 5. Displays "next steps" with example AI prompt to test
```

**Why:** Current onboarding requires multiple commands. Users drop off.

---

### 3. Quick Start Video/GIF
**Effort:** 1 day
**Impact:** High - increases README conversion

**Tasks:**
- Record 60-second demo showing:
  1. `pip install instructionkit`
  2. `inskit quickstart`
  3. Browse TUI, select instructions
  4. Install to project
  5. Open Cursor/Claude, show AI using the instruction
- Create animated GIF for README
- Upload full video to YouTube
- Update README with media at top

**Why:** Developers won't read walls of text. Show the tool in action.

---

### 4. Generate Your Own Instruction
**Effort:** 2-3 days
**Impact:** High - converts users from consumers ‚Üí creators

**Implementation:**
```bash
inskit create my-python-rules

# Opens editor with template:
# Name: my-python-rules
# Description: [fill in]
# Tags: [python, style]
#
# --- Instruction Content ---
# [AI assistant instructions here]
#
# Examples:
# - [example 1]
# - [example 2]

# After saving:
# ‚úì Validates format
# ‚úì Adds to local library
# ‚úì Prompts: "Install to current project? [y/n]"
```

**Why:** Users get hooked when they can create custom instructions easily.

---

## Tier 1: Virality & Network Effects üöÄ
**After 20-50 users, build things that make them share**

### 5. Expanded AI Tool Support
**Effort:** 3-5 days
**Impact:** Medium-High - significantly expands addressable market

**Current Support (4 tools):**
- ‚úÖ Claude Code
- ‚úÖ Cursor
- ‚úÖ Windsurf
- ‚úÖ GitHub Copilot

**New Tools to Add (9+ tools):**
- Gemini CLI
- Cursor Agent (if different from Cursor)
- Qwen Code
- opencode
- Codex CLI
- Kilo Code
- Auggie CLI
- CodeBuddy
- Roo Code
- Amazon Q Developer CLI

**Implementation Strategy:**
1. Research each tool's instruction format and location
2. Create AITool classes for each (similar to existing ClaudeTool, CursorTool, etc.)
3. Add detection logic to `detector.py`
4. Update TUI to show new tools
5. Add to documentation with setup instructions

**Prioritization within this feature:**
- **High Priority:** Amazon Q (AWS backing), Gemini CLI (Google backing)
- **Medium Priority:** Codex CLI, Qwen Code, Roo Code (growing tools)
- **Low Priority:** Smaller/niche tools (add as requested)

**Why:** Each new tool = new user segment. Some tools have large corporate backing (Amazon Q, Gemini). However, wait until core experience is solid with existing 4 tools.

**When to build:** After Sprint 1 completes and you have 20-30 active users. Validate which tools users actually want before building all integrations.

---

### 7. Export to Share
**Effort:** 1-2 days
**Impact:** Medium-High - enables viral sharing

**Implementation:**
```bash
# Export to GitHub Gist
inskit export python-style --format gist
# Creates gist, returns URL

# Import from shared link
inskit import https://gist.github.com/troylar/abc123

# Export to file for copying
inskit export python-style --format standalone
# Creates single .md file with metadata
```

**Why:** Makes it easy to share one instruction with colleagues. "Try this!"

---

### 8. Community Instruction Templates
**Effort:** 3-4 days
**Impact:** Medium - lowers barrier to quality

**Implementation:**
```bash
inskit template list
# Available templates:
# - python-style-guide
# - react-best-practices
# - api-design-principles
# - testing-guidelines
# - code-review-checklist

inskit template use python-style-guide
# Opens interactive form:
# - Max line length? [88]
# - Import style? [absolute/relative/both]
# - Type hints? [required/optional/none]
# - Docstring format? [Google/NumPy/reStructuredText]
#
# Generates customized instruction from template
```

**Why:** Templating helps users create quality instructions without starting from scratch.

---

### 9. "Show HN" / Reddit-Ready Features
**Effort:** 2 days
**Impact:** Medium - builds social proof

**Implementation:**
- Add opt-in telemetry: `inskit stats --anonymous`
- Public stats page at instructionkit.dev/stats (static page)
  - "X projects using InstructionKit"
  - "Y instructions shared"
  - "Z downloads this month"
- Add `--anonymous-usage` flag on first run (ask permission)

**Why:** Social proof. People trust tools others use. "1,247 developers use InstructionKit"

---

## Tier 2: Product Excellence ‚ú®
**Make existing features exceptional**

### 10. Better Conflict Resolution
**Effort:** 2-3 days
**Impact:** Medium - reduces installation friction

**Current:** "File exists. Skip/Rename/Overwrite?"
**Improved:** Side-by-side diff showing changes

```bash
inskit install python-style

‚ö†Ô∏è  Conflict detected: python-style already installed

Your version (installed 2 weeks ago):
  Line 15: Max line length: 100
  Line 23: Use single quotes for strings

New version (from company-instructions):
  Line 15: Max line length: 120
  Line 23: Use double quotes for strings

What would you like to do?
  [K]eep your version
  [R]eplace with new version
  [M]erge (open diff tool)
  [V]iew full diff
```

**Why:** Currently a pain point that makes users abandon installation.

---

### 11. Instruction Validation & Linting
**Effort:** 3-4 days
**Impact:** Medium - improves instruction quality

**Implementation:**
```bash
inskit lint my-instruction.md

Checking: my-instruction.md
‚ùå Too long (3,450 words) - AI may ignore parts
   Recommendation: Split into multiple instructions or reduce to <2,000 words

‚ö†Ô∏è  No examples provided
   Recommendation: Add 2-3 concrete examples

‚ö†Ô∏è  Vague language detected: "code should be clean"
   Recommendation: Be specific (e.g., "use descriptive variable names")

‚úì Clear structure
‚úì Appropriate length
‚úì No contradictions detected

Score: 6/10 - Needs improvement
```

**Why:** Quality instructions = better AI results = happy users.

---

### 12. Smart Project Detection
**Effort:** 2-3 days
**Impact:** Medium - feels magical, increases adoption

**Implementation:**
```bash
cd my-fastapi-project
inskit install

üîç Project detected: Python FastAPI application

Recommended instructions:
  ‚òê python-best-practices (from examples)
  ‚òê fastapi-patterns (from examples)
  ‚òê api-security (from examples)
  ‚òê pytest-guidelines (from examples)

Select all? [Y/n]
```

**Detection logic:**
- Scan `pyproject.toml`, `package.json`, `go.mod`, etc.
- Detect frameworks (FastAPI, React, Django, etc.)
- Suggest relevant instructions from library

**Why:** Reduces decision fatigue. Just say yes.

---

## Tier 3: Ecosystem Building üå±
**Only after 100+ active users**

### 13. Public Instruction Registry (Simple)
**Effort:** 5-7 days
**Impact:** Medium - creates ecosystem without infrastructure

**Implementation:**
- Create `instructionkit/awesome-instructions` GitHub repo
- Static website (GitHub Pages): instructionkit.dev/browse
- Users submit PR to add their instructions
- Categories: Python, JavaScript, DevOps, Security, etc.
- Each listing:
  ```yaml
  - name: Advanced Python Patterns
    author: "@username"
    description: "Enterprise Python best practices"
    url: https://github.com/user/python-instructions
    tags: [python, advanced, enterprise]
    installs: 234
  ```
- `inskit search` can query this index

**Why:** Creates ecosystem before building complex cloud infrastructure.

---

### 14. Instruction Testing Framework
**Effort:** 5-7 days
**Impact:** Medium - quality control

**Implementation:**
```bash
inskit test python-style

Running tests for: python-style

Test 1: Variable naming
  Prompt: "Create a variable to store user count"
  Expected: Descriptive name (e.g., user_count)
  Result: ‚úì AI used "user_count"

Test 2: Line length
  Prompt: "Write a long function call"
  Expected: Line breaks at 88 characters
  Result: ‚úì AI formatted correctly

Test 3: Type hints
  Prompt: "Create a function that adds two numbers"
  Expected: Type hints present
  Result: ‚úó AI didn't include type hints

Score: 2/3 tests passed

# CI/CD integration
inskit test --all --ci
```

**Why:** Prevents broken instructions from spreading.

---

### 15. Team Profiles
**Effort:** 3-4 days
**Impact:** Medium - first team collaboration feature

**Implementation:**
```yaml
# .instructionkit/team-profile.yaml
name: Backend Team Standards
version: 1.0.0

required:
  - python-style
  - pytest-guidelines
  - api-security

optional:
  - fastapi-patterns
  - database-best-practices

repositories:
  - url: https://github.com/company/instructions
    auto_update: true
```

```bash
# Team member joins project
git clone project
cd project
inskit sync-team

üì¶ Installing team requirements:
  ‚úì python-style (from company/instructions)
  ‚úì pytest-guidelines (from company/instructions)
  ‚úì api-security (from company/instructions)

Optional instructions available:
  ‚òê fastapi-patterns
  ‚òê database-best-practices

Install optional? [y/N]
```

**Why:** First step toward team collaboration, but keeps it simple (just a YAML file).

---

## Tier 4: Enterprise Features üè¢
**Only after 1,000+ users and clear demand**

### 16. Cloud-Based Instruction Server
**Effort:** 4-6 weeks
**Impact:** High - but premature right now

**Features:**
- Public registry with discovery
- Private team registries
- Cloud sync across devices
- Analytics & insights
- OAuth/SSO authentication

**Why Wait:**
- No users to host for yet
- High infrastructure cost

**Effort:** 2-3 weeks
**Impact:** Medium - but need users first

**Features:**
- Instruction adoption rates by team member
- AI code quality metrics before/after instructions
- Instruction effectiveness scoring
- Compliance tracking

---

### 18. Enterprise Authentication
**Effort:** 2-3 weeks
**Impact:** Medium - for large companies

**Features:**
- SAML/LDAP integration
- SSO with corporate identity providers
- Fine-grained RBAC
- Audit logs

---

### 19. Self-Hosted Deployment
**Effort:** 3-4 weeks
**Impact:** Medium - for regulated industries

**Features:**
- Docker/Kubernetes deployment
- On-premise installation
- Air-gapped environments
- Custom branding

---

## What NOT to Build Right Now ‚ùå

---

## Decision Framework

Before building ANY feature, ask:

1. **Will this get me more users?** (If no, deprioritize)
2. **Will this reduce friction for new users?** (If yes, prioritize)
3. **Can I validate this without building it?** (If yes, do that first)
4. **Do users actually want this?** (If unsure, ask)
5. **What's the minimum version I can ship?** (Build that, not more)

Remember: **Distribution >> Features** at this stage.

---

## Long-Term Vision (12-24 months out)

If InstructionKit succeeds, it becomes:
- **The npm for AI instructions** - standard way to share/distribute
- **Team collaboration platform** - how teams standardize AI workflows
- **Quality benchmark** - instructions tested and validated by community
- **Enterprise standard** - large companies use for AI governance

But to get there, we need users first. Focus on Tier 0 and Tier 1.

---

## Resources & References

**Inspiration:**
- npm (package discovery & distribution)
- Docker Hub (public + private registries)
- VS Code Extensions (marketplace with ratings)
- Homebrew (simple, focused CLI)

**Communities to Engage:**
- r/cursor
- r/ClaudeAI
- r/LocalLLaMA
- Cursor Discord
- Claude Discord
- Indie Hackers

**Content Ideas:**
- "How we improved AI code quality by 40% with instruction management"
- "The problem with copy-pasting AI prompts (and how to fix it)"
- "Building a team standard for AI coding"
- "From chaos to consistency: Managing AI instructions across tools"

---

## Personal Notes & Ideas

**Random thoughts to explore:**
- Could we scrape popular .cursorrules files from GitHub? Build initial corpus?
- Partnership with Cursor/Claude? Pitch as "official instruction manager"?
- "InstructionKit Certified" badge for quality instructions?
- Instruction marketplace eventually (like Gumroad for prompts)?
- Annual "State of AI Instructions" report?
- YouTube channel with instruction writing tutorials?

**Questions to answer:**
- What's the #1 pain point for AI coding tool users right now?
- Why would someone share their instructions publicly?
- What makes an instruction "high quality"?
- How do we measure if an instruction actually works?

---

**Remember:** This roadmap will change as we learn. Stay flexible. Talk to users. Ship fast. Iterate.
