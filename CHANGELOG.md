  - Detects missing files, local modifications, and outdated versions
  - Checksum-based verification using SHA-256 hashing
  - Validates template integrity across project and global scopes
  - `--fix` flag for automatic remediation of issues
  - `--verbose` flag for detailed diagnostic output
- **Automatic Backup System** - Protection against accidental data loss
  - Automatic timestamped backups before any template overwrite
  - Backups stored in `.ai-config-kit/backups/<timestamp>/`
  - `aiconfig template backup list` - View available backups
  - `aiconfig template backup restore` - Restore files from backups
  - `aiconfig template backup cleanup` - Remove old backups (default: 30 days)
  - Support for both project and global scopes
- **Interactive Conflict Resolution** - User prompts for template conflicts
  - Rich terminal UI for conflict resolution choices
  - Three strategies: Keep local, Overwrite (with backup), or Rename
  - Side-by-side conflict information display
  - Prevents accidental overwrites of modified templates
- **Template Repository Scaffolding** - Create new template repositories with one command
  - `aiconfig template init` - Generate scaffolded template repository
  - Pre-configured `templatekit.yaml` with examples
  - Example templates with comprehensive documentation
  - Ready-to-use directory structure for all template types
  - Automatic README and .gitignore generation
- Template-specific CLI commands:
  - `aiconfig template init` - Create new template repository
  - `aiconfig template install` - Install templates from library
  - `aiconfig template list` - List available templates
  - `aiconfig template update` - Update installed templates
  - `aiconfig template uninstall` - Remove installed templates

### Changed
- Default conflict resolution strategy changed from `skip` to `prompt` for template operations
  - Users are now interactively prompted when conflicts are detected
  - Provides better visibility and control over file operations
- Enhanced README.md with comprehensive template sync documentation
  - Added validation command reference with examples
  - Documented backup management workflow
  - Updated features section with safety improvements
  - Added template system architecture documentation

### Fixed
- Templates with local modifications are now safely detected before updates
- Conflict resolution now creates backups before destructive operations

## [0.3.1] - 2025-10-27

### Fixed
- Git repository updates now work correctly - `.git` directory is preserved during download (#16)
  - Previously, downloading from Git URLs would skip the `.git` directory, preventing `aiconfig update --all` from working
  - Update command would show "Not a Git repository (local source)" for all Git-based repositories
  - Now the entire `.git` directory is copied to the library alongside instruction files
  - Enables proper Git-based updates via `aiconfig update --all` and `aiconfig update --namespace`
  - Local (non-Git) sources continue to work as before

## [0.3.0] - 2025-10-27

### Breaking Changes
- **GitHub Copilot file extension**: Instructions now use `.instructions.md` extension (was `.md`) (#15)
  - Required by GitHub Copilot's [official specification](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/configure-custom-instructions/add-repository-instructions)
  - Previous installations with `.md` extension will not be recognized by Copilot
  - **Action required** if you have existing Copilot instructions:
    ```bash
    aiconfig uninstall <instruction-name> --tool copilot
    aiconfig install <instruction-name>
    ```
  - Affects: GitHub Copilot only (Cursor, Claude Code, Windsurf unchanged)

### Added
- Git-based repository versioning support - download and manage multiple versions of instruction repositories
  - `aiconfig download --ref <tag|branch|commit>` to download specific Git references
  - Support for tags (e.g., `v1.0.0`), branches (e.g., `main`), and commit hashes
  - Multiple versions of the same repository can coexist in the library
  - Version information tracked in installation records (`source_ref` and `source_ref_type`)
  - Automatic update behavior: branch-based installs auto-update, tag/commit-based installs remain pinned
  - `aiconfig update` intelligently updates only mutable references (branches)
  - Version display in TUI installer and `aiconfig list` commands
- **Upgrade detection and prompts** - when installing a newer version of an existing instruction:
  - Automatically detects version changes (e.g., v1.0.0 → v2.0.0)
  - Displays side-by-side version comparison with old and new versions
  - Prompts for user confirmation before upgrading
  - Works across all AI tools (Cursor, Claude Code, Copilot, Windsurf)
- **Name collision handling** - when installing instructions with duplicate names from different repositories:
  - Detects when instruction name already exists from a different repository
  - Displays detailed information about existing and new installations
  - Allows users to provide custom filename to avoid conflicts
  - Option to skip installation if collision cannot be resolved
  - `find_instructions_by_name()` method in `InstallationTracker` for collision detection
- New `RefType` enum for tracking Git reference types (tag, branch, commit)
- `GitOperations` class with functions for:
  - `detect_ref_type()` - automatically determine if a reference is a tag, branch, or commit
  - `validate_remote_ref()` - verify Git references exist on remote before cloning
  - `clone_at_ref()` - clone repository at a specific Git reference
  - `check_for_updates()` - check if updates are available for branch-based repos
  - `pull_repository_updates()` - pull latest changes with conflict detection
- Versioned namespace generation in `LibraryManager`:
  - `get_versioned_namespace()` - creates unique namespaces like `repo@v1.0.0`
  - `list_repository_versions()` - lists all downloaded versions of a repository
- Enhanced update command with progress bars and detailed status reporting
- Comprehensive unit tests: 72 new tests, improving coverage from 46% to 57%

### Changed
- `InstallationRecord` now includes `source_ref` and `source_ref_type` fields for version tracking
- Library organization now supports version-specific namespaces (e.g., `github_com_user_repo@v1.0.0`)
- Update workflow now filters installations by ref mutability (only updates branches)
- Installation workflow now includes upgrade and collision checks before file operations

## [0.2.0] - 2025-10-24

### Changed
- Project-scoped installations now use relative paths in `installations.json` for version control compatibility (#8, #9)
- Removed `project_root` field from `InstallationRecord` model
- Installation tracking files are now safe to commit to version control across different machines

### Added
- Comprehensive release workflow documentation in CLAUDE.md with GitHub Actions automation
- Unit tests for relative path functionality in installation tracking
- Automatic migration from absolute to relative paths on save

### Fixed
