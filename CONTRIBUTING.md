# Contributing to AI Config Kit

Thanks for your interest in improving AI Config Kit! This project thrives on community involvement. The guidelines below help you get started quickly and keep contributions consistent and high-quality.

## 🧭 Ways to Contribute

- Report bugs or suggest enhancements via GitHub issues
- Improve documentation or examples
- Add new instruction management features
- Help expand platform/tool support
- Review and test pull requests from other contributors

If you are unsure where to begin, check the **good first issue** label or ask in a discussion.

## ⚙️ Development Environment

AI Config Kit uses [Invoke](https://www.pyinvoke.org/) to orchestrate common tasks. After cloning the repo:

```bash
pip install invoke
invoke dev-setup
```

This installs AI Config Kit in editable mode with all development dependencies.

### Available Invoke Tasks

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `invoke test` | Run the full pytest suite |
| `invoke test-unit` / `invoke test-integration` | Target specific suites |
| `invoke quality` | Lint (ruff), format check (black), and type-check (mypy) |
| `invoke format --check` | Verify formatting only |
| `invoke typecheck` | Run mypy alone |
| `invoke security-check` | Run safety + bandit scans |
| `invoke build` | Build publishable distributions |
| `invoke release-check` | Full pre-release checklist |

## 🧱 Branching & Commit Style

- Fork the repository or create a topic branch from `main`
- Keep branches focused and small; group related changes together
- Write clear commit messages in the conventional style, e.g., `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`
- Rebase on the latest `main` to avoid merge commits when possible

## 🧼 Coding Standards

- Python 3.10+ with type annotations where practical
- Follow ruff and black defaults (`invoke quality` catches both)
- Keep functions small and intention-revealing, favoring pure logic where feasible
- Update or add tests alongside code changes to retain coverage expectations

## ✅ Testing Expectations

Before opening a pull request:

1. `invoke quality`
2. `invoke test`
3. For dependency or security updates, run `invoke security-check`

GitHub Actions will run the same tasks across multiple Python versions.

## 🔄 Pull Request Process

1. Ensure your branch is up to date with `main`
2. Open a PR with a concise summary and checklist of changes
3. Link related issues or discussions
4. Expect at least one maintainer review before merge
5. Address review feedback promptly; feel free to push follow-up commits

PRs that pass CI, include tests, and document user-facing changes are merged fastest.

## 🗣️ Communication

- Use GitHub Discussions or Issues for design proposals and questions
- Tag maintainers when feedback is blocking
- Be patient and respectful—maintainers are often volunteering their time

## 🚀 Releases

Releases are managed by maintainers. If you need a release:

1. Confirm `invoke release-check` passes
2. Update `pyproject.toml` with a new version
3. Document changes in the release notes / changelog
4. Request a maintainer to cut a release via the publish workflow
