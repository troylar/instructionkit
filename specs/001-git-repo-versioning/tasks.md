# Tasks: Git-Based Repository Versioning

**Feature Branch**: `001-git-repo-versioning`
**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-git-repo-versioning/`

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-8)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - Can proceed in priority order: US1 (P1) ‚Üí US2 (P1) ‚Üí US3 (P1) ‚Üí US4 (P2) ‚Üí US5 (P2) ‚Üí US6 (P3)
  - Or in parallel if multiple developers available
- **Polish (Phase 9)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P1)**: Depends on US1 (needs version info from downloads) - BUT can be independently tested
- **User Story 3 (P1)**: Depends on US1 and US2 (needs installations to update) - BUT independently testable
- **User Story 4 (P2)**: Depends on US1 and US2 (needs versioned downloads and installations)
- **User Story 5 (P2)**: Depends on US2 (needs installation tracking)
- **User Story 6 (P3)**: Depends on US3 (extends update functionality)

### Within Each User Story

- Setup before implementation
- Implementation before testing
- Core functionality before polish
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- Phase 1: T002 and T003 can run in parallel (different parts of models.py)
- Phase 2: T006 and T007, T010 can run in parallel (different functions)
- Phase 9: All test tasks (T053-T060) can run in parallel, all documentation (T061-T063) can run in parallel

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies, can run in parallel
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story delivers independent value and is testable on its own
- All new code must include type hints and pass mypy strict mode
- Minimum 80% test coverage required
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Reference GitHub issue in all commit messages
- Follow existing InstructionKit code style and patterns
- Avoid breaking changes to existing CLI commands
