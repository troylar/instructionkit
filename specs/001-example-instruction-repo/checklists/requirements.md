# Specification Quality Checklist: Example Instruction Repository

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-24
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Notes

**Content Quality**: ✅ PASS
- Specification focuses on what users need (example instructions for first-run experience)
- No technical implementation details mentioned
- Clearly written for business stakeholders understanding value proposition

**Requirement Completeness**: ✅ PASS
- All 12 functional requirements are testable and unambiguous
- Success criteria all measurable with specific targets (e.g., "within 2 minutes", "10-15 instructions", "80% of users")
- All success criteria are technology-agnostic (focused on user outcomes, not implementation)
- 3 user stories with complete acceptance scenarios
- 5 edge cases identified
- Clear scope with Assumptions and Out of Scope sections
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present

**Feature Readiness**: ✅ PASS
- Each functional requirement maps to user scenarios and success criteria
- User scenarios cover P1 (discovery), P2 (navigation), P3 (team collaboration)
- Measurable outcomes directly support business goals (time-to-value, activation rate)
- Specification is purely what/why focused, no how/implementation details

## Overall Status

**✅ READY FOR PLANNING**

All checklist items passed. Specification is complete, unambiguous, and ready for `/speckit.plan` command.
