# Tasks: Example Instruction Repository

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-example-instruction-repo/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (complete), spec.md (complete), research.md (complete), data-model.md (complete), quickstart.md (complete)

**Tests**: This feature does not require automated tests. Validation is manual via AI tool testing (80% guideline adherence).

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Example Repository**: `troylar/instructionkit-examples/` (new GitHub repository)
- **InstructionKit CLI**: `instructionkit/` (existing repository, documentation updates only)

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Repository Initialization)

**Purpose**: Create GitHub repository and basic structure

- [ ] T001 Create GitHub issue for this feature with label "enhancement"

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Team Lead Shares Examples as Starting Point (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Complete repository documentation enabling team collaboration and instruction authoring

**Independent Test**: Clone project with installed instructions ‚Üí team member gets same files via Git ‚Üí team member can create custom instruction following README guidance

### Implementation for User Story 3

**Repository Documentation**:

- [ ] T048 [P] [US3] Complete `README.md` in troylar/instructionkit-examples with: installation instructions, instruction list with descriptions, how to use examples, how to create similar instructions (per quickstart.md guidance)
- [ ] T049 [P] [US3] Update `CONTRIBUTING.md` with: how to improve existing instructions, how to propose new instructions, PR process, testing requirements

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Story 1 (Phase 3)**: Depends on Foundational completion - MVP
- **User Story 2 (Phase 4)**: Can start after Foundational, but logically after US1 for content consistency
- **User Story 3 (Phase 5)**: Depends on US1 and US2 having content to document
- **Polish (Phase 6)**: Depends on all user stories complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: No dependencies on other stories - independently valuable (7 instructions across all categories)
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: No hard dependency on US1, but builds upon it (adds 5 more instructions for total of 12)
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Depends on US1 and US2 content existing (documents the 12 instructions created)

### Within Each User Story

**User Story 1**:
- T010-T013 (Foundation) MUST complete before any content creation
- T014-T020 (Content creation) can all run in parallel (different files)
- T021 (Metadata) depends on T014-T020 complete
- T022-T028 (Validation) can run in parallel, each depends on its corresponding content file
- T029-T031 (Integration) depends on all validation passing

**User Story 2**:
- T032-T036 (Content creation) can all run in parallel
- T037 (Metadata) depends on T032-T036 complete
- T038-T042 (Validation) can run in parallel
- T043-T047 (Search testing) depends on T037 (metadata with tags)

**User Story 3**:
- T048-T050 (Repository docs) can run in parallel
- T051-T052 (CLI docs) can run in parallel with repository docs
- T053-T055 (Testing) depends on all documentation complete

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks (T004-T008) can run in parallel after T003
- All Foundational tasks (T010-T013) can run in parallel
- All content creation within a story can run in parallel:
  - US1: T014-T020 (7 instruction files simultaneously)
  - US2: T032-T036 (5 instruction files simultaneously)
- All validation tasks within a story can run in parallel (after content exists):
  - US1: T022-T028 (7 validations simultaneously)
  - US2: T038-T042 (5 validations simultaneously)
- All Polish tasks (T056-T059) can run in parallel

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1 Content Creation

```bash
# After Foundation (T010-T013) completes, launch all instruction creation in parallel:

Task: "Create instructions/python-best-practices.md"
Task: "Create instructions/python-async-patterns.md"
Task: "Create instructions/javascript-modern-patterns.md"
Task: "Create instructions/pytest-testing-guide.md"
Task: "Create instructions/api-design-principles.md"
Task: "Create instructions/security-guidelines.md"
Task: "Create instructions/git-commit-conventions.md"

# All 7 can be written simultaneously (different files, no dependencies)
# Then sequentially: Update instructionkit.yaml (T021) after all content exists
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T009)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T010-T013) - CRITICAL checkpoint
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (T014-T031)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test download ‚Üí browse ‚Üí install independently
5. If passing: Deploy to GitHub, announce availability

**Result**: 7 high-quality instructions covering all required categories, fully validated, ready for users

### Incremental Delivery

1. Setup + Foundation ‚Üí Repository exists with templates
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí **Release v1.0.0** (7 instructions - MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí **Release v1.1.0** (12 instructions total)
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí **Release v1.2.0** (full documentation)
5. Each story adds value without breaking previous functionality

### Parallel Team Strategy

If multiple people are working:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together (sequential, small)
2. Once Foundational done (T013 complete):
   - **Person A**: Python instructions (T014, T015, T022, T023)
   - **Person B**: JavaScript instruction (T016, T024)
   - **Person C**: Testing + API instructions (T017, T018, T025, T026)
   - **Person D**: Security + Git instructions (T019, T020, T027, T028)
3. One person handles metadata (T021) after content complete
4. All test integration together (T029-T031)

---

## Notes

- **[P]** tasks = different files, no dependencies
- **[Story]** label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- No automated tests - validation is manual via AI tool testing
- Commit after each task or logical group (e.g., after all US1 instructions created)
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- This is content creation, not software development - focus on quality writing and validation
- Repository evolves independently from InstructionKit CLI (FR-012)
